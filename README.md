# **MAXathon LaunchPad**

# **Get You Repository**

- In order to get a repository, just register your submission on [this platform](https://platform-hackathon.maxonrow.com/) and make sure at least one team member has their GitHub profile provided & linked. Your team repository will then be created for you, and you will have full access.
- Source code submissions need to be made using your team's repository.
- You can choose to work in a repository elsewhere (e.g. under your own GitHub user) provided you pull the latest version into your team's repository for judging. Make sure whatever code you have is committed to your official repository by 11.59pm Wednesday 30-September-2020. You may continue editing until the deadline, as long as some of your code is in by 11.59pm.
- Please ensure to create your project name (this name will be used for your github repository)

# **Rules**
- You will receive a GitHub repository from the organisation to submit your work. Only submissions in your official repository will be considered.
- You may use existing code to start with, but you must make clear which new work you have produced in the hackathon. Your submission will be judged only on the new work.

# **Judging Process & Criteria**
- Pitch : The 20 finalist teams will pitch their solution via the platform on 3-October-2020. Each team will have 10 minutes, including the Q&A session.
